Before using, hook up the Arduino's D2 and D3 pins (with the .ino file already uploaded) to the mouse's micro switch.

Once the software is up and running and everything's connected, just hit "pause" â€“ it'll show you the actual delay between when the micro switch clicks and when your computer picks up the key event.
